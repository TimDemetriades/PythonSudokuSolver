# PythonSudokuSolver

Simply run **SudokuSolver.py** and it will solve the puzzle defined in the file. Currently, it will only solve the defined puzzle, but if you edit the puzzle in the file you can solve others.

If you would like to have it solve the NYTimes Daily Sudoko puzzle, run **NYTimesSudokuSolver.py**. It is capable of solving all 3 difficulties, easy, medium, and hard. Alternatively, you can run the GUI version, **NYTimesSudokuSolverGUI.py**. The program may take a few seconds to load, as it solves all of the puzzles at the start.

Here is a video of the program in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8BOQ5PLv-c
