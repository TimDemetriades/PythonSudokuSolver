# PythonSudokuSolver

Simply run SudokuSolver.py and it will solve the puzzle defined in the file. Currently, it will only solve the defined puzzle, but if you edit the puzzle in the file you can solve others.

My goal is to make it able to read a webpage of the NYTimes Daily Sudoku and have it solve that.
